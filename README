Project 2

This project is a memory-map simulator contained in a single .c file.
To compile:
  ~$ gcc main.c



Here is a sample run:

 ~$ gcc main.c -o mmap
 ~$ ./mmap
Memory size>2000
Page Size (1:100, 2:200, 3:400)>1
Input file: in.txt
Simulation completed.
 ~$ ./mmap
Memory size>3000
Page Size (1:100, 2:200, 3:400)>2
Input file: in.txt
Simulation completed.
 ~$ ./mmap
Memory size>4000
Page Size (1:100, 2:200, 3:400)>3
Input file: in.txt
Simulation completed.

The 'in.txt' used for these runs and the output files 'out1.txt', 'out2.txt',
and 'out3.txt' produced by these runs have been included in the project.

As stipulated in the project outline, memory size up to 30000 is supported.
The simulation runs until all processes have completed or up to 100000 seconds,
whichever comes first.
The program assumes that 'Memory size' is a multiple of 'Page Size'.
